## Overview

In 2019 [RJ Andrews](https://infowetrust.com/) created a series of SVG patterns based on the late 1800s *French Albums de Statistique Graphique* by engineer and data visualization pioneer [Émile Cheysson(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Cheysson)].

The patterns were so lovely, but fiddly to incorporate into online charts. I wanted to make them more easily accessible to anyone making charts online, particulary those built in JavaScript or D3.

So I created an [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tomshanley/cheysson-color-palettes) that provides all the palettes, with an easy couple of lines of code. The beautiful palettes are now easily available to anyone who uses Observable.

Have a look on the example map below!

For a detailed introduction to the palettes, the albums they were drawn from and background on their authors, please read [RJ Andrew's article from January 2020](https://infowetrust.com/project/album-colors).
