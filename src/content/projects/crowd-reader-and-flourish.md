## Overview

[Crowd Reader](https://www.crowdreader.com/) is a highly innovative market research software company that uses AI-assisted software to scan and analyses millions of real-time online conversations in social media and beyond to capture unfiltered fan reactions to athletes, teams, events or moments, so event organisers, team administrators and funding agencies can make confident, data-backed decisions.

I worked with Crowd Reader to create online ready snapshots of fan engagement across many sporting events in 2024.  I built these using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), which provides no-code interactive visualisations from a wide range of options.

Have a look at the examples below!

Fan engagement over the New Zealand Super Rugby Season 2024:
