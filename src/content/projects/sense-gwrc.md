## Overview

**PromptSmith** is a prompt management interface built for developers, researchers, and creators working with OpenAI’s API. It offers a streamlined workflow to organize, tag, and version prompts — making experimentation and reuse effortless.

## Features

- 🧠 Version-controlled prompts
- 🏷️ Tag system for categorization
- 📤 Export prompts to JSON for easy integration
- 🔍 Search and filter UI
- 🌗 Dark mode support
- ⚡ Built with Astro + TypeScript

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Serverless (Optional), File-based storage or Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Why I Built This

Managing prompts manually in notepad files or scattered in code wasn't scalable — especially when iterating rapidly. PromptSmith brings order to chaos, with a minimal interface that respects developer ergonomics.
