## Overview

In 2021 I worked with [Sense Partners](http://www.sense.partners/) who develop population forecasts for the [Greater Wellington Regional Council](https://www.gw.govt.nz/).

I built the [website](http://demographics.sensepartners.nz/) to visualise their forecasts for interested public, community groups, senior council officers and councillors - to access, understand and use key forecast outputs and data.

The visualisations were primarily built using [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Bootstrap Tables](https://bootstrap-table.com/).

Examples of the charts and maps:
