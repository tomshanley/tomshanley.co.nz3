## Overview

**FormSync** is a drop-in solution for handling forms without setting up a backend. Just add a form to your site, and it handles the rest — validation, spam filtering, and sending submissions directly to your inbox.

## Features

- 📨 Email notifications instantly on form submission
- 🔒 reCAPTCHA support for spam protection
- 💾 No backend required — serverless & scalable
- ⚙️ Simple HTML form integration
- 📊 Optional dashboard for managing submissions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, minimal client JS
- **Backend**: Serverless functions (e.g. Vercel, Netlify)
- **Third-party**: reCAPTCHA, Email APIs (e.g. Resend)

## Why I Built This

Integrating backend logic just to send a contact form felt excessive — I wanted a plug-and-play solution that respected both frontend simplicity and backend power.
