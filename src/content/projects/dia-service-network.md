## Overview

In 2017 I was asked to help the Service Innovation team at Department of Internal Affairs to build a visualisation of the government services and how they link to different events in people’s lives.

I used Kumu to build an interactive network diagram, which allowed people to explore the data from different viewpoints, such as person’s life event, a government agency or a particular service.

The final visualisation was also used as part of a presentation to the Minister of Internal Affairs.

Screenshorts of the interactive visualisation:

## Features

- 📋 Task + habit tracking in one interface
- 🌓 Light and dark mode
- 🚫 No dependencies, zero client-side JS required
- 🔄 Syncs with local storage or minimal backend
- ⚡ Instant-load experience with offline fallback

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro, Vanilla JS (optional), Tailwind
- **Enhancements**: Progressive enhancement, Service Workers
- **Deployment**: Static-first, ideal for Vercel or Netlify

## Why I Built This

I wanted a personal tracker that wouldn’t guilt-trip me with streaks, ads, or clutter. Just a clean interface that loads instantly and lets me log what matters — then gets out of the way.
