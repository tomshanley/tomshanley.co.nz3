## Overview

In 2017 I assisted Superu (The Familiies Commission) with their analysis and visualisation of data for the *Families and Whānau Status Report*.

I developed charts that helped the analysts understand their data better, and then produced final charts for inclusion in the [final published report](https://thehub.sia.govt.nz/assets/documents/F&W%202017%20report%20WEB.pdf).

Some of the charts included in the report:


*Bubble heat map showing the Prevalence of domain disadvantage for families experiencing multiple disadvantages*

*Diverging bar chart showing the number of people who can provide help and support*

*Tree showing Indicators and life domains used in Superu’s multiple disadvantage measure*

In addition to the Families and Whānau Status Report, I also contributed designs for charts for the [Youth Mental Health Project](https://thehub.sia.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Youth-Mental-Health-Project-At-a-Glance.pdf) and [Land Use Regulations reports](https://thehub.sia.govt.nz/resources/quantifying-the-impact-of-land-use-regulation-evidence-from-new-zealand-2/).
